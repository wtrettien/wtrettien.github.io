I'm Whitney and I'm a researcher who works in digital humanities. I'm particularly interested in the ways that old books are being digitized for new media. To learn more about my engagement with the interdisipclinary field of DH over the last three months, please see my statement about my interests.

I've also provided a few things I'd like to [explore in the future](lookingforward.md).
